As an admin of the Codetrybe web application, I want to have exclusive access to the signup page so that I can create user accounts for teachers, students, and other users.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Only the admin user should be able to access the signup page.
- The signup page should allow the admin to create user accounts for teachers, students, and other users.
- When creating user accounts, the admin should be able to enter relevant information such as username, password, phone number, address, email, and other specific details.
- Upon successful creation of a user account, the user should be able to log in to the application using the provided credentials.
- The signup page should provide appropriate feedback and error messages if there are any issues during the account creation process.

2. After successful login, the admin navigates to the signup page.
3. The system verifies that the logged-in user is an admin and grants access to the signup page.
4. On the signup page, the admin sees options to create user accounts for teachers, students, and other users.
5. The admin selects the appropriate option based on the type of user account they want to create.
6. The system presents a form to the admin, requesting relevant information such as username, password, phone number, address, email, and other specific details based on the selected user type.
7. The admin fills in the required information in the form.
8. The admin submits the form to create the user account.
9. The system validates the entered information and creates the user account accordingly.
10. If the account creation is successful, the system provides feedback to the admin indicating that the account has been created.
11. The admin can proceed to create additional user accounts or navigate to other pages within the application.
12. If there are any issues during the account creation process (e.g., invalid or duplicate information), the system displays appropriate error messages to the admin, allowing them to correct the provided information and resubmit the form.
